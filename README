EX: 1

FILES:
osm.cpp -- implementation of the osm library.
results.png -- graph of the results.
Makefile
README

REMARKS:
1) in the osm implementation, the number of iterations are rounded up by 50 due to the loop unrolling
2) the results in the graph were calculated by an average of 10^6 iterations.

ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
WhatIDo:
-requires a single input, let us call it INPUT
-let us call my username USRNAME

1) creates a set of directories and a file:
/Welcome/To/OS2018

2) in the file OS2018 writes:
USRNAME\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\nINPUT

where in my case USRNAME=guy.pelc
and INPUT is the input i entered when running the function from the terminal.

3) closes the file OS2018, then removes the directories "To" and "Welcome"
